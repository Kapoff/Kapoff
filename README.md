- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kapoff, a 3D artist
- 👀 I’m interested in basic automation, and all sorts of QOL improvements 
- 🌱 And I’m currently learning Python for the reasons mentioned above (and apparently C++ as well, because Epic locks all the cool shit away from basic BP).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on  pretty much nothing, simply because at my currect skill level, I would be a dead weight.
- 📫 How to reach me ... ... don't
